📝 **Project Summary**:  
In this Excel-based project, I analyzed a sample sales dataset to extract insights on product sales across different regions and categories. A `Total` column was calculated using the `=Quantity * Price` formula to determine the revenue from each order. I used Pivot Tables to summarize:

- Total sales by region
- Total sales by product
- Average sale per customer

To visualize the findings:
- A **bar chart** was created to show total sales across different regions.
- A **pie chart** was created to show the sales distribution (share) across product categories.

This project helped strengthen my Excel skills in building pivot summaries and using visualizations to interpret business performance.

- 🧮 Average sale per customer ranged between ₹1200 and ₹14000 depending on the product mix.
- Visuals made it easier to identify sales concentration across specific categories and regions.
